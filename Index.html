			<td><span>Captains and the Kings is a 1972 historical novel by Taylor Caldwell 
			chronicling the rise to wealth and power of an Irish immigrant, 
			Joseph Francis Xavier Armagh, who emigrates as a penniless teenager to the United States, 
			along with his younger brother and baby sister, only for their parents to die shortly afterwards. 
			Joseph Armagh befriends a Lebanese immigrant, and both are taken under the tutelage of an American plutocrat. 
			An inter-generational saga focusing on the themes of the American dream, discrimination and bigotry in American life, 
			and of history as made by a cabal of the rich and powerful, through Armagh's attempt to make his eldest son, who eventually becomes a senator, 
			the first Catholic President of the United States.</span></td>

			<span>Sequel to Dynasty of Death, and dealing this time more with the fortunes and the misfortunes of the somewhat decadent 
			inheritors of the Bouchard and Barbour fortunes and rights in munitions, than with the sweep of industry itself. 
			The period is perhaps two generations beyond the main period of Dynasty of Death. 
			The families have continued to intermarry, and their integrity seems to have dissipated in conflict over power, show, 
			wealth and personalities. Christopher, cold-blooded schemer, is out to ""get"" the brother who holds the titular headship, 
			and uses his brothers and even the little sister he pretended to adore, for his own ends.
